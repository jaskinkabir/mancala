# Mancala

This is my implementation of the board game Mancala in the Windows terminal using C++. This uses the same approach to displaying the board as my 2048 game, although it is more animated.
This was the final project for my Intro to C++ class.

## How to play
Download and launch Mancala GUI.exe from the releases tab. The instructions on how to play will be displayed when the game initializes.
