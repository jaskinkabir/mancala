# Mancala

This is my implementation of the board game Mancala in the Windows terminal using C++. This uses the same approach to displaying the board as my 2048 game, although it is more animated.
This was the final project for my Intro to C++ class.

## How to play
Download and launch Mancala GUI.exe from the releases tab. This is a two player game so both players will have to input their names when the program is launched. Afterwards, the game instructions will be displayed.
